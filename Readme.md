This was an exercise I did in creating an interface in JS (the CSS and HTML were provided) for a dice rolling game and is based on Jonas Schmedtmanns' Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview).

A very basic dice rolling game with the main objectives of this exercise being:
Learning how to manipulate the DOM
Learning how to read from the DOM
Learning how to change CSS styles

I've commented a lot of the code just to help me internalise this stuff, it's a mess, I know, so please just try to ignore that.
